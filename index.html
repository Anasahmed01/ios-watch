                                <li>Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch SE, and Apple Watch Series 3 have a water
                                        resistance rating of 50 meters under ISO standard 22810:2010. This means that
                                        they may be used for shallow-water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean.
                                        However, they should not be used for scuba diving, waterskiing, or other
                                        activities involving high-velocity water or submersion below shallow depth.
                                        Series 7 is also rated IP6x dust resistant.</li>
                                <li>Blood Oxygen app measurements are not intended for medical use, including
                                        self-diagnosis or consultation with a doctor, and are only designed for general
                                        fitness and wellness purposes.</li>
                                <li>The ECG app is available on Apple Watch Series 4 and later (not including Apple
                                        Watch SE) with the latest version of iOS and watchOS. See apple.com/lae/watch
                                        for compatibility details. ECG is not intended for use by people under 22 years
                                        old. With the ECG app, Apple Watch is capable of generating an ECG similar to a
                                        single-lead electrocardiogram.</li>
                                <li>Irregular rhythm notification requires the latest version of watchOS and iOS. It is
                                        not intended for use by people under 22 years old or those who have been
                                        previously diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (Afib).</li>
                                <li>Apple Watch Series 7 (GPS + Cellular) and Apple Watch SE (GPS + Cellular) can use a
                                        cellular connection for Emergency SOS. To use Emergency SOS on an Apple Watch
                                        without cellular, your iPhone needs to be nearby. If your iPhone isn’t nearby,
                                        your Apple Watch needs to be connected to a known Wi-Fi network and you must set
                                        up Wi-Fi Calling.</li>
                                <li>The international emergency calling feature requires an Apple Watch Series 7 (GPS +
                                        Cellular) or Apple Watch SE (GPS + Cellular) model. For a list of supported
                                        countries and regions, see apple.com/lae/watchos/feature-availability.</li>
                                <li>Wireless service plan required for cellular service. Contact your service provider
                                        for more details. Connection may vary based on network availability.
